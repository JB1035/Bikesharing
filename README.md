# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to understand trends from bike sharing-service, CitiBike, looking at data from August 2019 in NYC, to determine if a similar program can be open in Des Moines, Iowa. August is the busiest month of the year for bikesharing in NYC and was therefore used for the analysis.

Data was retrieved from Citbike's public website as a CSV and then updated in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype in hours and minutes. An updated CSV file was then uploaded to Tableau in order to visualize and analyze the data.
